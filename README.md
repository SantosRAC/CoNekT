# ![conekt logo](docs/images/icon-144x144.png "Conekt Logo") *CoNekT:* Coexpression Network Toolkit

What is CoNekT ?
----------------

CoNekT is an online platform that allows users to browse expression profiles, study expression specificty, co-expression
networks and more across different species. A public version including seven plant species which includes thousands of 
publicly available RNASeq samples (from the [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra)) is available 
[here](conekt.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/pub/).

Here you can find **Tutorials** how to use the public version along with the source-code and build instructions that 
allow you to host your own instance with other species or in-house data.
