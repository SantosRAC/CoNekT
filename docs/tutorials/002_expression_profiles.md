# Tutorial: Expression profiles, heatmaps and specificity

The key feature of CoNekT is the inclusion of thousands, carefully annotated, publicly available RNASeq samples
derived from the [Sequence Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). For each gene a summary of its expression in
the annotated samples, the expression profile, is available. Data for a collection of genes can be used to create
heatmaps and by applying various statistics genes specific for certain conditions, tissues or organs can be detected.
