    <p>Genes derived from a common ancestor, aka homologous genes, can be clustered into gene families. Usually genes
    are grouped into families by clustering the similarity scores of their protein products. Popular tools to cluster
    genes into homologous groups are Tribe-Mcl, OrthoFinder and OrthoMCL.</p>
